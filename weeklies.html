                    During the first week of this class, I have been presented with a lot of new 
                information. Having had no experience with coding and VSC, I was honestly pretty 
                nervous and kind of intimidated by all the new lingo. However, since the first day
                I have already been able to see progress within my own abilities and my level of 
                comfort with the material. I have been pleasently surprised by how much I have 
                started to enjoy working with VSC and the process of learning how I can apply this 
                on my own. I'm pretty excited to continue to learning all the capabilities of html 
                and what lies ahead and beyond that.
            
                    Some of the things that I have learned include how to create headers, how to use
                preformatted text and anchor tags, and how to insert and resize images. Below is a
                picture of one of my most-loved musician groups, <i>Caamp</i>, that links to my
                favorite song by them.

                This week, I really got to start exploring more within html when working on
            exercise 1. I am definetly getting more comfortable with inserting images, links,
            etc., which is something I never thought I would be able to say. I have truly found
            that the more time I spend applying my skills, the easier and more fun it gets. 
              
                We also started talking about css in class this week, which is a whole new level
            I am beginning to get excited about. Using color and being able to get more creative
            with the web sounds really interesting. Right now, however, I would say that css is
            still pretty intimidating as we have only just touched on it. But I am hoping that I
            have a similar expereince as I have had with html thus far, and learn to start really
            loving it the more I familiarize myself with css.
     
                I am also looking forward to the first presentation this week because I found the 
             timeline of the web to be pretty fasincating. It honestly has not been that long since 
             its implementation in society, so I can not even imagine what is still to come in our 
             lifetime!

                Throughout this week's classes and over the weekend I have really begun
            experimenting with css. I started working on my 'Five Variations' assignment, where
            I have honestly spent most of my time just learning all the capabilities within css. 
            Pretty overwhelming so far. 
        
                But I have decided to style the song "Strawberries", by Caamp, and I have gotten 
            pretty into trying to make it look aesthetic but also be meaningful in the design
            choices. I have definetly had difficulty in doing all the things that I want, and 
            also just figuring out what it is that I want it to look like, but it has still been
            pretty fun.
                    
                So far, I have completed two somewhat successful versions of "Strawberries",
            using floating boxes and an overflow scroll box. I had a really hard time wanting to
            implement an image as the footer, and while I still have not quite figured that out,
            I am hoping with more time and experience it will get easier.
        
                I am not sure what direction I want to go with my other three designs right now,
            but I am curious on how to make the text itself move, and might see if that is
            something I can do. I might honestly just go through the W3 site for some more
            inspiration and see where that takes me!

                After finishing my css "5 Variations", I can definitely say that I have made
            progress using VSC, but also that there are still specific things I want to get
            better at.For example, when my pages were projected onto the big screen, they weren't
            necessarily centered as they were on my own computer. In the future, I want to be
            able to code where my projects look the same no matter what size screen they are
            being displayed on.
     
                I also really enjoyed looking at what other students were working on and seeing
            how the same codes were used to different effects. Everyones poems were so unique and
            it was super cool to see how much variety exists within just one project and one class. 
     
            Looking forward to bettering my skills and becoming more comfortable navigating all
            this new information!

                Throughout this past week, I have been trying to mentally organize my thought
            process for my final webpage design. I have never made a digital portfolio before or
            created a personal website, so I am both nervous and excited to start this journey.
            As of now, I am wanting more of a 'cleaner' layout, but also a page that accurately
            displays my style and image as an artist. 
     
                I have started the very bare bones rough draft via Canva, but have hesitations
            that perhaps my expectations do not necessarily match my current coding skills.
            For this reason, I am trying to be a little reserved in the overall planned layout
            of my page, but I hope that I can progressively get more creative and detail oriented
            as the process goes on and my confidence builds. 
                 
                So far, I have had a little difficulty with simply identifying a solid color scheme
            that I feel matches the vibe of my sketched work. Because of this, I have hit a bit of
            a creative'block', but am thinking that this will clear once I have a clear vision of
            the work I want to include. There are a few different routes I am considering regarding
            what pieces I will include, but currently I am leaning more towards my 'scribbled' and
            less 'perfected' works.

                Since my last weekly, I have started to actually begin coding my portfolio
            homepage.I ran into a slight problem when I went to alight my navigational menu 
            buttons to the right, as the order reversed itself, but I am hoping to fix that
            soon. I am also planning on trying to see how I can make this collapsible and how
            I can insert a title text (my name) on the left side. 
                But honestly, I wish I had more progress to report on. I have been battling this
            mental'block' that I just can not seem to get past... Thinking I really just need to
            take some time to sit down and write a projective plan with smaller goals for myself.
            Hopefully, this will break up the project a bit and help me to more easily get in a
            groove of what I want to do.
                Right now, I think my first next-step is to really nail down what work I want to
            include and then use adobe-color to solidify a color scheme. Most of my work is very
            monochromatic as I mainly use just pen, so I guess my biggest struggle here has been
            choosing pieces that are different colors (purple and blue) and trying to figure out
            how I can make this cohesive as a page. But I have started via procreate trying to
            clean up some of my work to get rid of paper lines and make it more appealing for
            presentation purposes.

                This past week, I was introduced to java script for the first time in class. 
            And while I am feeling pretty out of my comfort zone with this, I still find it 
            extremely interesting to learn of all the capabilities that it has within coding. 
            I've even started to think of some ways in which I can apply a few of these new 
            features and effects in my portfolio page!
                I have not started my excercise 4 yet (as I am pretty intimidated), but I am
            hoping once I am able to really sit down and dedicate my focus to playing around
            and learning java, it will become more and more comfortable. I have noticed that
            the initial'starting' of new things has been difficult for me in this class, but
            it is encouraging to read my old reflections and already see some fruit from how
            I have grown. Really trying to be better at asking my questions after class, and
            not becoming too overwhelmed with the'newness' of it all. I truly do enjoy looking
            at what I have been able to create, but like I mentioned earlier, the first step
            is often the most difficult! Fingers crossed that next time I report I feel as
            though I am at a better spot with my webpage and with learning/using java!

                Happy to report that this past week I successfully completed exercise 4!
            While intimidated by Java, I found 'Coding Train' to be an extremely useful resource.
            There were multiple examples and lots of detail covering the basics, which is exactly
            what I need! Though I feel like I relied heavily on these tutorials and demonstrations,
            I do believe that I have learned a lot through the experimentation on my own end and
            the review/reiteration of earlier topics. 
                Overall, I really enjoyed looking at what everyone had come up with for this
            assignment, as there was so much variety and creativity among the submissions. 
            Always super impressed by the talents of my peers! 
                In continuation, I also had my discussion presentation this week on Crowds, Labor,
            and the Gig Economy. I personally found these readinds extremely interesting, especially
            with how relevant each concept is in relation to our own lives. More than this, learning
            about the ways they manifest throughout society was very mind boggling. Really 
            appreciated hearing others thoughts on this as well!
                As we are nearing the finsihline here, I'm anxious to see how my final webpage turns
            out along with everyone elses! I have a lot of work to do, but I am kinda of excited to
            see what I can do!

                Wow...the semester is already over! I truly cannot believe it... Mostly relieving
            at this point, but it seems each semester/year just keeps going faster. The grapple with
            time, man... I don't think I'll ever get over how truly insane it is!
                But taking a moment to reflect on this class in particular, I have learned a LOT. 
            Never in my LIFE, did I think I would ever be taking a coding class, much less enjoying 
            several parts of it! It has definetly been time consuming for me to familiarize myself 
            with the material, and equally frustrating, but I can finally say that I finsihed my
            Webpage! At least I'm pretty sure... hahaha there are still parts I would like to change,
            tweak, and detail more, however, due to time contraints and mental capacity, I think we've
            got what we can for the present! Fingers crossed that it projects well onto the overhead Monday!
                And speaking of the final project, I did have MAJOR hesitiations when it came to this.
            I kept changing my mind on how I wanted it to look, tutorials wouldn't pan out, and I 
            really just kept pushing it off because of how frustrated I got at points. But I really 
            am proud of myself for actually finsishing it and for the immense growth I made throughout
            the process and this class. I super enjoyed seeing all my artwork displayed together in an
            organized/custom internet space that is all my own, as I've never had that opportunity before!
                Looking forward to seeing what my peers came up with for their designs on Monday and also 
            looking forward to hopfully continuing learning/applying html,css, and java!
