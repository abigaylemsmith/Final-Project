        <p>Be my mind, don't like to think for myself
            all of the time. And
            be my soul, look into these eyes
            like no one before.
            Be my light, sunrise laughing
            'cause we stayed up all night.
            Be my map.
            And we'll leave with all the treasure we can grab, oh.
            Be my lake, summer sand
            and a strawberry milkshake.
            Be my pride, stay under my skin
            don't let me take what is not mine.
            Be my house, strong and sturdy
            far from town, oh.
            Be my home
            just think of all the places we'll go.
            Be my blood, oh, I'd shoot the moon
            and it wouldn't be enough.
            And be my books
            head on your shoulders with damn good looks.
            Be my hands
            and I'll paint your picture darling the best I can.
            Be my heart, and I've got you in the end
            I wish I had you from the start.
            </p>
