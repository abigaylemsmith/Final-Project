                    If I were to ruminate on how I was created, I would acknowledge how big my heart is. 
                I would speak of how I love to love and how I think the small things are really the big things.

            I would explain how being creative is the avenue in which I best experience this world and how 
                the sky makes me happy. 

            I would talk about how I love to read the way other people think and I would attempt to put into words 
                the way music makes me feel.

                I am a compilation of intricacies the Lord designed specially for me, and because of that, the way
                   in which I am made is wonderful.
