    <h2> "Blessed are those who dwell in your house, ever singing your praise!" (Psalm 84:4).</h2>
    <br>
    <pre>
        
    Not only have I been blessed with the gift of salvation, but I have been blessed in ways
    too numerous to count.

    My mother loves me too much and my dad is the best man I have ever known.
    I have friends who I call family 
    and a dog who wags her tail each time I step inside the door.

    I have a bed and a room, a best friend I can not choose, and the freedom that comes with 
    living a life for Jesus.
</pre>
